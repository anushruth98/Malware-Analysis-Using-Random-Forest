Our project's goal is to develop a system that can identify malwareâ€”dangerous software that has the potential to harm or interfere with systems and networks. We'll employ a machine learning method known as a Random Forest Classifier to do this. This method uses a variety of elements that are taken from the files to help us determine if a file is harmful or safe. 
 
First, a dataset including details on various files, including size, type, and behaviour, will be prepared. Additionally, our dataset will show whether or not each file contains malware. After that, we'll divide this data into two sets: one for model training and another for evaluating the model's performance.
 

We will train our Random Forest using the training set of data.
